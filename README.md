History: This was my very first game and project and thus is very old and outdated and is done with basically no understanding
of classes, coding pratices, and optimization. Turing is a teaching language used in Ontario secondary schools to teach the
basics of coding and using code to solve problems. DO NOT USE TURING AT ANY COST, PLEASE JUST ANYTHING ELSE.
